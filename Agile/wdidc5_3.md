A "Scrum"
============

* What are requirements?
* What is a backlog?
* What is a sprint?

* How are sprints budgeted?

Note:

Another student research task. Indicate that "budgeted" in this case means "made to fit in the alotted time".

Meetings
========

* What is a scrum meeting?
* What is the structure of a scrum meeting?
* What happens during a retrospective? A sprint review?
* Why have these meetings?

Note:

Another student research task.

* Standups are for quickly sharing coordination information: yesterday, today, blocks
* Communicaton!
* Sprints have clearly obtainable objectives, usually tied to user stories, sometimes called milestones
* Retros assess progress toward the sprint goals: glow, grow, shout outs
