- What is Authentication?

- What are Cookies?
- What is Hashing?

## Authentication

Authentication is the act of confirming the truth of an entity. In web applications, authentication refers to users identifying themselves through a login proceedure.

## Sessions

A session is a semi-permanent exchange of information between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user.

We interact with sessions all the time: have you ever logged into a website, and then logged back out? That sequence creates and then later terminates a session.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data issued by a website, which is then stored in a user's web browser. Every time the user reloads a website that has issued a cookie, the browser sends the cookie back to the server to notify the website of the user's previous activity.

Cookies are a mechanism for web applications to remember user-specific stateful information, such as items in a shopping cart or a login session.

## Hashing

Hasing is a one-way cipher that generates a "fingerprint" for a piece of data. The input data may be of any length, while the hashed output is always a fixed length. Example:

* Input: "hello world"
* Output: "2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed"
