## Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast OOP to other programming paradigms
- Describe abstraction and how it applies to objects
- Explain the difference between a class and an instance
- Explain the difference between class and instance methods
- Explain the advantages of using objects to group qualities and actions
- Write a class with an initialize method
- Instantiate and use an object
- Write getter and setter methods
- attr_accessor, reader, writer
- Describe the difference between local variables, instance variables, class variables and global variables
- Explain variable scope and how it works
- Use "self" to reference an object instance
- Explain the usage of inheritance
- Write a class that inherits from another class
- Use "super" to inherit data from a parent class
- Explain what object-oriented Programming is
- Explain what encapsulation is
- Explain the difference between public, private, and protected methods
- Create multi-file Ruby programs using 'require_relative'

## Intro to OOP

### Procedural 
- procedural vs object oriented
- procedural is like a string of christmas lights
  - one light goes out and the whole thing stops working
  - which bulb is the one that caused it?

### Object Oriented

- oop is like an lcd display
  - one pixel goes out, and itâ€™s hardly noticeable
- terms
  - encapsulation
    - You can drive a car without knowing how an engine works.
  - interface
    - why do cars have breaks?
  - modular
    - small, single-purpose collections of code 
- each object is defined by:
  - properties it has (attributes (formerly variables))
  - things it can do (methods)
  - variable : attribute :: function : method

## You Do: 1) Understanding Objects

## We do: 2) Implementing Objects (Orange Tree)

## You do: OOP Practice (11:30 - 12)

- & review

## We do: Orange Tree Redux (12pm)

- getter, setter methods
- attr_accessor, attr_reader, attr_writer
- variables:
  - local
  - instance
  - class
  - global
- methods:

## We do: Inheritance

- Car
  - Ford Focus
  - Delorean
- super

## You do: Super Heros Exercise

- & review

## Break

## We do: Encapsulation

- private
- public
- protected

## You do: The Landlord
