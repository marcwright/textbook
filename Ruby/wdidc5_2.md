### Learning Objectives

#### Ruby Basics
- describe the utility of computer programming
- define the role of a REPL in programming
- list 5 common data types used in ruby and their uses
- differentiate between statements and expressions
- describe what variables are and what they are used for
- explain the concepts of mutability and immutability
- describe what a method is and why they are useful
- differentiate between input, output and side effects for methods
- explain what a type error is
- use REPL
- create and run a ruby program

#### Ruby Control Flow
- explain why control flow is used in programming
- explain what conditionals are, and why we use them
- Use boolean logic (&&, ||, !) to combine and manipulate boolean statements
- Use if, else, elsif statements to control logic flow in a Ruby program
- Use Ruby case statements

### Data Types
- string
- integers
- floats
- boolean
- nil

### REPL
- Read
- Evaluate
- Print
- Loop

### Variables
- a container used to hold some data / points to an object in Ruby.
  - semantic naming

### Input, Output, Side Effects
- input are the arguments of a program or method
- output is what the program or method returns
- side effects are things that occur in addition to a programs output

### Mutability vs Immutability
- Whether something can be changed or not
  - often times you refer to an object and whether it has been mutated or not

### True Vs False
- truthy vs falsey
  - only nil and false is falsey, everything else in ruby is truthy

### Control Flow Keywords
- if
- elsif
- else
- while
- until
- end
