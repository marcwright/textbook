Objectives
==========

* Identify agile practices
* Categorize agile practices by which agile principle they support
* Imagine a typical day and week on an agile team
* Contrast user stories and tickets
* Describe what makes a useful meeting

Note:

* Framing by caricature: cowboy coder and incompetent manager
* Helps us manage complexity by focusing on things that do matter instead of things that might matter; gets developers out of the "prediction" game
* Briefly mention [extreme programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)

---

[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
======================================================================

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

> * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> * Working software over comprehensive documentation
> * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> * Responding to change over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Note:

* Ask students "What does this mean to you? Can you think of examples in your previous experiences that make you sympathetic or skeptical of the agile philosophy?"
* Contrast this with "Waterfall" and previous development processes

## Shortest Description Ever

- Try something
- React to **Feedback**

---

## Introduce Agile Methodologies

1. Scrum
2. Lean
3. Extreme Programming

---

## Embrace Change

- Deliver quickly
- Respond to emerging requirements


---

## Scrum

- The Daily Scrum
- The Sprint Backlog
- The Sprint (fixed duration iteration)
- The Sprint Review
- The Sprint Retrospective

- Scrum Master (more than )

Note:

Borrowed rugby term

Not really a methodology, more a framework for managing tasks.
Self-organizing teams.

All of these deal with the task management
What's missing?  Engineering tasks.

---

## Lean Software Development

- Translate Manufacturing Concepts
  - Optimize the **whole** line
  - Unused Inventory
  - Waste

---

## Extreme Programming (XP)

- Turn it up to 11!
- Remember the human
- Engineering tasks support agile management

Note:

Common Themes?
=============

Common Themes
=============

- Communication
- Feedback loops
- Iteration, incremental wins
- Managing process
- Stakeholder involvement

Note:

* Ask for clarification rather than make assumptions
* Shorter feedback loops are better than longer
* Shorter feedback require shorter (and more frequent) iterations
* Be mindful of obstacles, and adapt to avoid them
* Having customers involved makes development faster, communication easier

## My Lamentation

- Strength is in the combined support
- Manager's hubris

- My personal opinion

---

## Exercise: Optimize the Line

---

# How do we choose the highest value?

---

# User Stories

- What is the structure of a user story? Why?
- How are user stories different than bugs? Than tickets? Than epics?
- What makes a good user story?

Note:


Students should break into groups to research these questions.

- User stories are high-level and give context to developers and designers

---

## User Stories

> As a ..., I want to ..., so that ...

* [INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29)

---

## An Iteration

Phases of Development
=====================

* Ideation
    * Brainstorming
    * Negotiation
    * Wireframing
    * Design (front and back)
    * Spiking, research
* Execution
    1. Plan
    1. Break it down
    1. Assign
    1. Do it (with someone else!)
    1. Retro
    1. `goto` Step 1

---

> Economists do it with models.

---

> But programmers do it in pairs.

---

Takeaways
=========

* Ask questions, express concerns
* Advocate for your customer and yourself
* Maintain inertia
* Be mindful
