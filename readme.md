# The GADC Textbook

This is intended for notes and lesson plans **only**. Starter code, in-class exercises, homework, and everything else should have their own individual repositories.

This is intended to give easy access to the collective knowledge of all instructors, past and present. Therefore, **please keep branching to a minimum**. Branching should be for collaboration between instructors only; then the branches should be merged to Master and deleted. If you want to make branches for starter code and/or solution code, that's a good indicator whatever you're working on should have its own repo.

If you want to make a change to a lesson plan, just duplicate it, name it appropriately, and change away! It's better to have too many lesson plans than too few, as long as everything is organized appropriately.
