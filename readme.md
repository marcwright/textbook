# The GADC Textbook

## What goes in here
This is intended for notes and lesson plans **only**. Starter code, in-class exercises, homework, and everything else should have their own individual repositories.

### Branches
This is intended to give easy access to the collective knowledge of all instructors, past and present. Therefore, **please keep branching to a minimum**. Branching should be for collaboration between instructors only; then the branches should be merged to Master and deleted. If you want to make branches for starter code and/or solution code, that's a good indicator whatever you're working on should have its own repo.

If you want to make a change to a lesson plan, just duplicate it, name it appropriately, and change away! It's better to have too many lesson plans than too few, as long as everything is organized appropriately.

## Naming
Lesson plans should be named according to the class during which they were taught (e.g. "wdidc5.md").

If you find yourself wanting to hint at the topic in the filename, make a directory for that topic. For example, if you want to make a file called "wdidc5_tdd.md", instead make a directory called "tdd" and put the "wdidc5.md" file inside that directory.

If a topic is the name of a **specific technology or application**, like jQuery, ActiveRecord, or Backbone, give the topic a top-level directory.

If a topic is a **programming concept**, like TDD or OOP, make it a sub-directory of the language/technology through which it's being presented, like "Ruby/OOP" or "JS/OOP".
